# klaf.js 4.0.0 Migration Guide

## Major Changes

klaf.js 4.0.0 introduces several significant changes that you should be aware of when updating your existing applications. The key changes are outlined below:

### Indexing Behavior Change

In previous versions, klaf.js would create indexes for all properties defined in a schema by default. Starting with version 4.0.0, this behavior has changed: **indexes are no longer created for all properties by default.**

* **Default Indexes**: Automatic indexes are now only created for essential system properties such as `documentIndex`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.
* **Manual Index Creation**: To create an index for any other property, you must explicitly set the `index: true` option in your schema definition for that property.

```javascript
// Example: User schema definition with 'username', 'email', 'age'.
const userSchema = {
  username: { // 'username' is a property of your document
    default: () => '',
    index: true,
    validate: (value) => typeof value === 'string' && value.length > 0
  },
  email: {
    default: () => '',
    // No 'index: true', so no index will be created for 'email' by default
    validate: (value) => typeof value === 'string'
  },
  age: {
    default: () => 0,  // Provides a default value for 'age'
    index: true        // Explicitly create an index for 'age'
  },
};
```

To maintain indexing for fields that were previously indexed by default, you must explicitly set `index: true` for those fields in your schema definition. If you do not take these steps, newly inserted documents will not have these fields indexed.

### Default `payloadSize` Change

The default `payloadSize` for data records has been increased from `1024` to `4096`.

* This change allows for storing more data per record by default but may affect overall database size and memory usage.
* You might need to adjust this default value based on the specific data characteristics of your application.

### New `cacheLifespan` Constructor Option

A new `cacheLifespan` option has been added to the database constructor (e.g., `Klaf.Open` or `KlafDocument.Open`).

* **Purpose**: This option controls the duration for which data is held in an internal cache. It is designed to enhance performance by keeping frequently accessed data readily available, making overall operations smoother.
* **Behavior**: Data retrieved from the database will be cached for the duration specified by `cacheLifespan`. Subsequent requests for the same data within this lifespan can be served from the cache, reducing database load and improving response times.
* **Default Value**: The default value for `cacheLifespan` is `3m` (3 minutes). If not specified, data will be cached for this duration.
* **Caution**: While caching improves performance, setting `cacheLifespan` to a very large value, especially in conjunction with frequent database operations, can lead to increased memory consumption. If the cache duration is too long and the database is used heavily, memory reclamation might become challenging, potentially causing the application to use a significant amount of memory. It's important to balance the performance gains with the potential memory impact based on your application's specific usage patterns and available resources.

```typescript
// klaf.js 4.x
import { Klaf } from 'klaf.js';
import { FileSystemEngine } from 'klaf.js/engine/FileSystem';

// Example: Using cacheLifespan to cache data for 60 seconds
const dbWithCustomCache = await Klaf.Open({
  path: 'my_database_with_cache.db',
  engine: new FileSystemEngine(),
  cacheLifespan: '60s' // Cache data for 60 seconds (60000 ms), or '1m'.
});

// Example: Disabling internal cache by setting cacheLifespan to 0
const dbWithoutCache = await Klaf.Open({
  path: 'my_database_without_cache.db',
  engine: new FileSystemEngine(),
  cacheLifespan: 0
});
```

### No Longer Need to Create `DataJournal` Instance

In previous versions (like klaf.js 3.x), you needed to manually create a `DataJournal` instance and pass it to the database options to enable journaling.

**Before (klaf.js 3.x):**

```typescript
import { Klaf, DataJournal } from 'klaf.js';
import { FileSystemEngine } from 'klaf.js/engine/FileSystem';

const db = await Klaf.Open({
  path: 'my_file_path.db',
  engine: new FileSystemEngine(),
  journal: new DataJournal(new FileSystemEngine()), // Manually creating DataJournal
});
```

As of version 4.0.0, **you no longer need to create `DataJournal` instances manually.** The `journal` option in the database constructor (e.g., `Klaf.Open` or `KlafDocument.Open`) is now a boolean:

* It defaults to `true`, meaning journaling is enabled by default.
* You can explicitly set `journal: true` (which is the same as the default).
* To disable journaling, you set `journal: false`.

This change simplifies library usage and allows for more concise initialization code, as the management of `DataJournal` is now handled internally.

**After (klaf.js 4.x):**

```typescript
// klaf.js 4.x
import { Klaf } from 'klaf.js'; // DataJournal import is no longer needed for this
import { FileSystemEngine } from 'klaf.js/engine/FileSystem';

// Journaling is enabled by default (journal: true is implicit)
const dbWithJournalDefault = await Klaf.Open({
  path: 'my_database_journal_default.db',
  engine: new FileSystemEngine(),
});

// Explicitly enabling journaling (same as default)
const dbWithJournalEnabled = await Klaf.Open({
  path: 'my_database_journal_enabled.db',
  engine: new FileSystemEngine(),
  journal: true,
});

// Disabling journaling
const dbWithoutJournal = await Klaf.Open({
  path: 'my_database_no_journal.db',
  engine: new FileSystemEngine(),
  journal: false,
});
```

### Changes to `DataEngine` Abstract Class

The `DataEngine` abstract class has new abstract members that must be implemented by any custom engine subclasses. This is a breaking change if you have your own `DataEngine` implementations.

|Type|Description|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|`get clone(): DataEngine`|(Abstract Getter) Must be implemented to return a new, uninitialized, and independent instance of the custom DataEngine.|This is a newly added abstract getter. Subclasses of `DataEngine` must now implement this to allow cloning of the engine instance, typically for the journal.|
|`async reset(file: string): Promise<void>`|(Abstract Method) Must be implemented to completely reset the engine's state for the given file, reverting it to an initial, unbooted, and unopened state. Any resources (like file descriptors) should be released, and internal caches or states cleared.| This is a newly added abstract method. Subclasses of `DataEngine` must now implement this to handle full state reset and cleanup.|

**If you have extended `DataEngine` to create a custom storage engine, you will need to add implementations for the `clone` getter and the `reset` method to your subclass for it to be compatible with klaf.js 4.0.0.**

For example:

```typescript
// MyCustomEngine.ts
import { DataEngine } from 'klaf/engine/DataEngine'; // Adjust path as necessary

class MyCustomEngine extends DataEngine {
  // ... other existing implementations ...

  get clone(): MyCustomEngine {
    // Return a new instance of MyCustomEngine, in its initial state
    return new MyCustomEngine(/* constructor arguments if any */);
  }

  async reset(file: string): Promise<void> {
    // Implement logic to fully reset the engine's state for the given 'file'
  }

  // ... other abstract method implementations (boot, create, open, close, etc.) ...
}
```

## Migration Steps Summary

1. **Review and Update Schemas**:

* Explicitly add `index: true` within the field definition object for all fields that require an index (e.g., `fieldName: { default: () => ..., index: true }`).
* For fields that were previously indexed but no longer need to be, you can remove `index: true`. New data for these fields will not be indexed.

1. **Review `payloadSize`**: Check if the new default `payloadSize` (4096) is suitable for your application. Set a custom value if necessary.

1. **Consider `cacheLifespan`**: Evaluate the new `cacheLifespan` option (specified in milliseconds). This option controls internal data caching to enhance performance. Be mindful that a very large `cacheLifespan`, especially with frequent database use, can increase memory consumption. Adjust based on your application's needs and resources.

1. **Remove `DataJournal` Instantiation**: If you have code that manually instantiates `DataJournal`, remove it.

1. **Update Custom `DataEngine` Implementations**: If you are extending `DataEngine`, you **must** implement the new abstract `clone` getter and `reset` method.
